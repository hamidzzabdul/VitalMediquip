                            We don't show prices on our website or documents because we sell products from many different
                            brands. For example, we have two brands of infrared thermometers, Blunt Bird and Dikang. Each of
                            these brands has its own price. That's why we can't put fixed prices on our website, as they vary
                            depending on your chosen brand.<br /><br />
                            If you let us know which brand you're interested in, we'll gladly tell you the price for that specific brand.
                            Just reach out to us, share the brand you prefer, and we'll provide you with the price. We're here to help
